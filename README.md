Project Name: Flames (C++ implementation)

Purpose: To predict the relationship between two people based on the letters in their names.

Key Features:

User Input: Prompts the user to enter two names.
Name Comparison: Compares the letters in the names, identifying and removing matches.
Outcome Calculation: Determines the residual number of letters and uses a modulo operation to assign a value between 1 and 5.
Relationship Prediction: Maps the calculated value to one of six possible relationship outcomes:
1: Friends
2: Lovers
3: Affection
4: Marriage
5: Siblings
Default: Error handling (should not occur in normal execution)
Output: Displays the predicted relationship.
Technical Details:

Programming Language: C++
Standard Library: Utilizes iostream, string, and std namespace.
Control Flow: Employs for loops, if statements, and a switch statement.
String Manipulation: Uses getline(), cin, erase(), and string comparison.
Modulo Operation: Calculates the final relationship value using the modulo operator (%).
Target Audience:

Individuals interested in lighthearted relationship predictions.
Students learning C++ programming concepts.
